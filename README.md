# Lambda Validation with Firebase

Using the Amazon template, this shows how to valdiate a Firebase token (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens) with NodeJs and a Lambda function.  This can then be used in API Gateway to validate API usage.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository.
* Run npm install from the project root.
* Zip the following:
 * node_modules
 * package.json
 * server.js

In AWS, create a new Lambda function.

* Set the following environment variables under the Advanced section of the Code tab.
 * firebaseUrl - https://[appname].firebaseio.com
 * firebasePrivateKey - from property 'private_key' of the private key json file
 * firebaseClientEmail - from property 'client_email' of the private key json file
 * firebaseProjectId - from property 'project_id' of the private key json file
 * See the Admin Setup from Firebase docs (https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) on how to setup admin access. 
* Upload the zip file of code on the Code tab; once uploaded to you can edit the code via the inline Lambda editor.
* Configure the test input.

```javascript
{
  "authorizationToken": "",
  "methodArn": "arn:...../*/GET/",
  "type": "TOKEN"
}
```

## AuthorizationToken

The authorization token can be fetched from via the following snippet:

```javascript
firebase.auth().currentUser.getToken(/* forceRefresh */ true).then(function(idToken) {
  // Send token to your backend via HTTPS
  // ...
}).catch(function(error) {
  // Handle error
});
```

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin#redirect-mode for more info.
